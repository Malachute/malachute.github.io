title: RIP Google PageRank Scores and how it shaped the industry
---
Interesting points are made from (Danny Sullivan at Search Engine Land)[http://searchengineland.com/rip-google-pagerank-retrospective-244286]. SEO never used to be only about backlinking. Google always had several factors that tied into rankings, even in the early days. Now with accurate visitor tracking, Google doesn't need to inform others how it ranks pages in its index.

> The absence of PageRank scores may cause some to seek alternatives, estimates from third parties about how authoritative pages might be. These remain, of course, just guesses. Only Google itself knows the actual PageRank score for a page — and as can’t be said enough, the score alone isn’t the only thing that determines if a page ranks well.

> In other words, don’t fixate on scores, either Google’s scores, for the remaining few weeks they’ll be around, or third-party scores. For some, they can be a useful way to focus. But for too many, they can become an obsession that pulls away from other types of SEO work that can be done.
