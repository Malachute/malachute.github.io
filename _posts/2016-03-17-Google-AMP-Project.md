Experimented with Jekyll and Google AMP to create a website that supported AMP from top to bottom. Meaning that every single page you visit adheres to the validation tool they provide. This means they can index the website and serve it from any of their CDN centers. Read more about Google AMP here.

Theme is based on Medium's website and the jekyll version taken from this [Github repo](https://github.com/ageitgey/amplify).
